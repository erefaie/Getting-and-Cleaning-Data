## Project Description
This Codebook file shows how to collect, work with and clean dataset


###Collection of the raw data
The R script will download the zip file containing the files


###Notes on the original (raw) data 
Some additional notes (if avaialble, otherwise you can leave this section out).


###Guide to create the tidy data file
Data collected and arrange as follows:
* create folder for the assignment files
* download files
* Read X and Y tables
* Read the features file to use them as variables names
* read the activities labels
* get list of variables names from features.txt file
* rename test data set variables
* rename train data set variables
* rename activity column to activity id
* add new column for activity label
* Bind the two data sets


###Cleaning of the data
- extract only the variables of mean and std and store the result in new dataset called tidy_ds
- update the activity description value
- create dataset for average
- write data to file
- 

##Description of the variables in the tidy_ds.txt file
General description of the file including:
- The file has the mean and STD variables
- Activity_ID – Numeric variable – activity number
- Activity_Label – String variable – activity label read from activity_labels.txt files



##Library used
Dplyr
